All right then - this is my portfolio site, i've made it, because i felt weird without anything that keeps all my stuff in there as live view projects + navigation to the code, and it's clearly mine. At the start, i had an idea, concept, i used Adobe XD to create all the components, and to grab the concept for mobile/desktop views, and i was like WOW, this is it. :) BUT! after i already wrote the code, and seen this site/project many many... todly many times i'm like eehh it's still poor and phi, easy to write heheh. Maybe it is, but my knowledge is just above 1 year, and i had no react in my job, but i always wanted to see how it goes, and gettin addicted of it. <br>
Besides... in the future, i'm going to add some:

- Themes (i though that i could do it easly with SASS variables colors, but nope! have to 'rethink' the idea of it, probably switch for theme class that will change the colors, i'll figure it out later
- Languages, especially English... i know i can use package and do it quick, but yee.. i'll go through it as soon as possible, for now i wanted to make it PL for PL companies to get hire huh ;)
- LANDSCAPE orientation - fuck no! i missed it, probably i'll add the same mobile components JUST for mobile phones by checking your OS or something 
- If Themes, then would be nice to add some authorization and keep all changes toggle for every single user
- MORE projects, in comming weeks i'll add at least two projects!


## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your project directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd my-default-starter/
    npm install
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `my-default-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
